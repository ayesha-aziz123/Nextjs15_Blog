          About Next.js
        </h1>
        <p>
          Next.js is an open-source React framework that has become a key player
          in modern web development. Developed by{" "}
          <i className="font-semibold"> Guillermo Rauch</i> and released by
          Vercel (formerly ZEIT) in <span className="font-semibold">2016</span>{" "}
          Next.js simplifies the process of building optimized, scalable web
          applications. By offering features like server-side rendering (SSR)
          and static site generation (SSG), it allows developers to enhance
          performance and SEO out of the box. Over time, Next.js has seen
          numerous updates that have significantly expanded its capabilities.
          The framework&apos;s journey began with Next.js 1.0, which introduced
          core features such as automatic server rendering and code splitting.
          Version 2.0, released in March 2017, focused on enhancing development
          for smaller projects, improving build efficiency, and scaling the
          hot-module replacement (HMR) feature. In 2018, Next.js 7.0 brought
          support for React&apos;s Context API and introduced improvements in
          dynamic routing.As Next.js evolved, it introduced cutting-edge
          features that reshaped web development. Version 9.3, released in 2020,
          added support for Sass and CSS Modules, while the following version,
          9.5, introduced Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), enabling
          content updates without rebuilding the entire site. Next.js 10,
          released in 2020, further refined the framework with built-in image
          optimization, enhancing page load speeds.Version 11, released in 2021,
          focused on improving developer experience with features like real-time
          collaboration tools and Webpack 5 support. The addition of Rust-based
          compilers in Next.js 12 (October 2021) boosted performance, while also
          introducing Edge Functions and Middleware for more dynamic routing.
          The release of Next.js 13 in late 2022 marked a turning point with the
          introduction of the App Router, React Server Components, and streaming
          support, laying the groundwork for the highly anticipated Turbopack
          bundler.

          Next.js 15 introduces a suite of advanced technologies designed to
          enhance application performance and streamline development workflows.
          However, developers may encounter challenges such as deployment
          hurdles and dependency conflicts. By understanding these potential
          issues and leveraging the new features effectively, developers can
          build more robust and efficient applications. Key updates, including
          the transition from Squoosh to Sharp, changes to cache semantics, and
          the deprecation of certain props, provide valuable opportunities to
          optimize Next.js applications. Staying informed about these changes
          and following best practices will help ensure a smooth transition to
          Next.js 15. Embracing the innovations in Next.js 15 while being
          mindful of its nuances empowers developers to maximize the frameworkâ€™s
          potential, creating applications that are both future-ready and
          high-performing.
