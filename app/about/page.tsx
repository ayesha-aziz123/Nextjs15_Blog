          Next.js is an open-source React framework that has become a key player
          in modern web development. Developed by Guillermo Rauch and released
          by Vercel (formerly ZEIT) in 2016 Next.js simplifies the process of
          building optimized, scalable web applications. By offering features
          like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), it
          allows developers to enhance performance and SEO out of the box
        </p>

        <p className="content  lg:text-[20px] text-[17px] mt-7">
          Over time, Next.js has seen numerous updates that have significantly
          expanded its capabilities. The framework&apos;s journey began with Next.js
          1.0, which introduced core features such as automatic server rendering
          and code splitting. Version 2.0, released in March 2017, focused on
          enhancing development for smaller projects, improving build
          efficiency, and scaling the hot-module replacement (HMR) feature. In
          2018, Next.js 7.0 brought support for React&apos;s Context API and
          introduced improvements in dynamic routing.As Next.js evolved, it
          introduced cutting-edge features that reshaped web development.
          Version 9.3, released in 2020, added support for Sass and CSS Modules,
          while the following version, 9.5, introduced Incremental Static
          Regeneration (ISR), enabling content updates without rebuilding the
          entire site. Next.js 10, released in 2020, further refined the
          framework with built-in image optimization, enhancing page load
          speeds.Version 11, released in 2021, focused on improving developer
          experience with features like real-time collaboration tools and
          Webpack 5 support. The addition of Rust-based compilers in Next.js 12
          (October 2021) boosted performance, while also introducing Edge
          Functions and Middleware for more dynamic routing. The release of
          Next.js 13 in late 2022 marked a turning point with the introduction
          of the App Router, React Server Components, and streaming support,
          laying the groundwork for the highly anticipated Turbopack bundler.

          Next.js 15 introduces a suite of advanced technologies designed to
          enhance application performance and streamline development workflows.
          However, developers may encounter challenges such as deployment
          hurdles and dependency conflicts. By understanding these potential
          issues and leveraging the new features effectively, developers can
          build more robust and efficient applications. Key updates, including
          the transition from Squoosh to Sharp, changes to cache semantics, and
          the deprecation of certain props, provide valuable opportunities to
          optimize Next.js applications. Staying informed about these changes
          and following best practices will help ensure a smooth transition to
          Next.js 15. Embracing the innovations in Next.js 15 while being
          mindful of its nuances empowers developers to maximize the frameworks
          potential, creating applications that are both future-ready and
          high-performing.
